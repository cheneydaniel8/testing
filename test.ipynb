    "There's nothing that we American tennis fans love more than cheering on USA's finest during the US Open tournament. But while Serena Williams always seems to find her way to the top of the women's bracket, the talent on the men's side of the game rarely makes the headlines.\n",
    "\n",
    "The highest ranked men's singles player on the ATP tour right now is a fella named John Isner, currently ranked 10 in the world. John, or \"Big John\" as he is affectionately known as in the tennis community, is a monster on the tennis court. Standing at 6'10'', John is most well-known for having an incredibly powerful serve. He has recorded serve speeds of up to 149.9 miles per hour, which visibly intimidates opposing players, even at the professional level.\n",
    "\n",
    "https://youtu.be/cgdTzXL86XM <--- Have a look at John smacking a few at this character\n",
    "\n",
    "Even with John's success cracking into the elite top 10, many consider him to be a one-dimensional player, with his massive serve being his only true weapon. His most obvious weaknesses on the court are his movement and his backhand. John's matches tend to be boring and predictable - he wins his service games and loses his opponent's services games, without many long exchanges mixed in. Certain friends of mine claim that he would be nothing without his serve, and I myself have to admit to changing the channel during one (or a few) of Big John's matches, saying, \"This goofy bastard will never win a major.\" But how is it that this alleged one-dimensional player remains at the top-end of PROFESSIONAL tennis and hasn't been \"figured out\" by these other top players?\n",
    "\n",
    "This question has prompted me to dig a little deeper into John Isner's game, and more specifically his serve, to try and figure out what he's really made of."
